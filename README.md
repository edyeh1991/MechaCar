# MechaCar

# Background
From the upper management team, Jeremy received two datasets:

The results of an mpg testing dataset of 50 potential prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each vehicle.
MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacity of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across lots.
By combining his understanding of R and statistics with the manufacturing datasets provided by the upper management, Jeremy should have all the materials he needs to generate a robust technical report. Technical reports such as the one Jeremy will design are common in product development and are used to justify design choices using quantitative and qualitative reasoning.

# Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to complete the following:

Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
